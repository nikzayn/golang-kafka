# Golang Kafka
- Kafka is an event streaming platform. Let's implement the kafka functionality with golang as a stack.

# How Kafka works
- So basically kafka works on pub-sub system means there would be a event which gets published by a Publisher and it stores the data, it allows the Consumers to read those events in that particular order in which they are published. 

# Project
- Building a real time notification system using golang and kafka as a practice project to get more familiar with the distributed system.
